The current version of the instance list format only depends on a small subset of the SearX Space instances.json.
Future version might add new entries, but should still allow importing this subset.

The configuration format is an exact representation of the contents of the web-extension local-storage.
Importing a configuration hoists the result of JSON.parse() onto the install configuration.
These entries can be considered stable.
