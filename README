SearX Tool - Build a local index of SearX instances.

SearX Tool presents a local search which selects from an index of SearX instances (think SearXNG neocities).
It regularly keeps up-to-date with one or more remote sources and/or allows maintaining a local index.
By default a list of instances is fetched from https://searx.space.
Other sources may be added, currently only through directly modifying the extension configuration.

Currently there is feature parity between the extension loaded on both Chrome and Firefox,
although some web-extension features supported by Firefox allow the right-click menu to look a little nicer.
