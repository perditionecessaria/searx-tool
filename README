SearX Tool - Build a local index of SearX instances.

SearX Tool presents a local search which selects from an index of SearX instances (think SearXNG).
It regularly keeps up-to-date with one or more remote sources and/or allows maintaining a local index.
By default a list of instances is fetched from https://searx.space.
Other sources may be added, currently only through directly modifying the extension configuration.

Note for Chrome users:
There is currently no convenient way to manually add, remove or blacklist instances,
as the Firefox extension loads the script modifying the right-click menu as part of a HTML page
and Service Workers don't allow loading background pages by default.
Accounting for this fact would require a substantial rewrite.
